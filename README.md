## About

There are two implementations.

The first, and original one is in the `/python` folder - see
[here](/python/README.md) for the README.md of that implementation.

The Python implementation is kept for archival and reference purposes. It will
have no further development in this repository.

The second, and newer implementation is in the `/rust` folder - see
[here](/rust/README.md) for the README.md of that implementation.

The Rust implementation is being developed actively.
